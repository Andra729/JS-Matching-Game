# JS-Matching-Game
You should see 2 boxes on your screen. Both boxes are displaying smiling faces to you. The white box is your playing area.

In the white one, there is one more face displayed. You have to find it, and click/tap on it.
If your guess was right, on the next level, it will generate 5 more faces in the playing area, and so and so. 
Evey time you have to find the extra, and the game continues atomatically.

Enjoy!
